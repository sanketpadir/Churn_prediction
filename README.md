# Churn_prediction :
Welcome to the project! This repository contains an comparison of alorithms from that we can conclude that which algorithm we gonna use for to production that predicts the person is exited or retained credit card use using a given dataset. 
The dataset includes the following features:  CreditScore, Geography	,Gender	,Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary, Exited

1.CreditScore

2.Geography

3.Gender

4.Age

5.Tenure

6.Balance

7.NumOfProducts

8.HasCrCard

9.IsActiveMember

10.EstimatedSalary

11.Exited

The independent variables are 'CreditScore','Geography','Gender','Age','Tenure','Balance','NumOfProducts','HasCrCard','IsActiveMember','EstimatedSalary'. The dependent variable is 'Exited'. The prediction of exited or retained depends on the independent variables, and each independent variable directly impacts the charges.


# libraries and tools :
The code is written in Python and utilizes the following libraries and tools:

numpy

pandas

sklearn

matplotlib

seaborn

# conclusion : 
Based on the above comparison, the algorithm that shows the highest test accuracy after hyperparameter tuning is the 
Random Forest algorithm. Therefore, if you prioritize test accuracy, Random Forest would be the preferred choice for model
training.

# how to optimized and increase accuracy : 

To increase the accuracy of the other models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Adaboost, you can try the 
following techniques:
    
1.Feature engineering: Analyze and preprocess your data to extract more meaningful features that can better represent the
underlying patterns in your dataset.

2.Hyperparameter tuning: Use techniques like grid search or random search to explore different combinations of 
hyperparameters for each model. This process can help you find the optimal set of hyperparameters that improve model 
performance.

3.Ensemble methods: Consider using ensemble methods like bagging or boosting. For example, you can combine multiple
Logistic Regression models or Decision Tree models to create an ensemble model, which can potentially improve 
performance.

4.Data augmentation: If you have a small dataset, you can generate synthetic samples through techniques like data
augmentation. This can help increase the diversity of your training data and improve generalization.

5.Regularization: Apply regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and enhance the 
model ability to generalize to unseen data.

6.Cross-validation: Utilize cross-validation techniques to assess the performance of your models more accurately and 
avoid overfitting to the training data.

7.Model selection: Consider trying other algorithms that may be more suitable for your dataset. Different algorithms have
different strengths and weaknesses, so exploring alternatives could lead to better results.

note : Remember, improving model accuracy is an iterative process that requires experimentation and careful analysis of 
your data. It is important to consider the specific characteristics of your dataset and problem domain when choosing and 
optimizing models.
